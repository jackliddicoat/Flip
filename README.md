# Flip
Code for reducing many matrices. Gives insights into what proportion of Flip game boards are solvable. Algorithm is not as efficient as we would like it to be, so we're working on a more efficient one at this time. The other notebook shows a user how to solve a given board of their choice.

Make sure to read our accompanying paper to make sense of the code before running it.

Note: If you haven't downloaded Sage and ran it locally, you can just run the code in SageCell: https://sagecell.sagemath.org
